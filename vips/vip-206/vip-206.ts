    description: `#### Summary

If passed, this VIP will configure the PrimeLiquidityProvider contract, starting accruing rewards for Prime holders

#### Description

This VIP is the forth one on the deployment plan of Venus Prime. [Check the updated Venus public documentation](https://docs-v4.venus.io/whats-new/prime-yield) to review the details of the deployed Venus Prime program. This VIP is part of the proposal [Venus Tokenomics Upgrade v3.0 Proposal](https://community.venus.io/t/venus-tokenomics-upgrade-v3-0-proposal/2782), published in the Venus community forum. The Venus Prime finally released has several differences with the original program proposed.

The full deployment of Venus Prime needs 5 VIPâ€™s. These are the details of the full deployment plan:

1. Enable Prime token, and allow users to claim them ([VIP-201](https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/201))
2. Set the rest of the timestamps when users staked more than 1,000 XVS on the XVSVault ([VIP-202](https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/202) and [VIP-203](https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/203))
3. Configure the PrimeLiquidityProvider contract, starting accruing rewards for Prime holders (this VIP)
4. Resume Prime

Specifically, in this VIP the following actions will be performed:

1. Transfer funds from the [Venus Treasury](https://bscscan.com/address/0xf322942f644a996a617bd29c16bd7d231d9f35e9) to the [PrimeLiquidityProvider](https://bscscan.com/address/0x23c4F844ffDdC6161174eB32c770D4D8C07833F2) contract. These funds will be distributed among the Prime holders.
- 150,666.50 USDT
- 61,329.43 USDC
- 2.18 BTC
- 42.23 ETH
1. Set distribution speeds in the PrimeLiquidityProvider contract. Set to distribute the previously transferred amounts **in 60 days**: 1,728,000 blocks.

#### Security and additional considerations

We applied the following security procedures for this VIP:

- **Venus Prime configuration post upgrade**: in a simulation environment, validating the behavior of the Venus Prime tokens is the expected one after the VIP
- **Deployment on testnet**: the same contracts were deployed and configured to testnet, and used in the Venus Protocol testnet deployment
- **Audit: OpenZeppelin, Certik, Peckshield and Fairyproof have audited the deployed code**
- **Contest**: Code4rena performed a contest on the Prime codebase
