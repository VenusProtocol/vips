- Liquidation Fees: $328,304
- Total: $3,704,219

**Tokenomic Allocations:**

- XVS Buyback: 89,392 XVS ($740,844)
- Venus Prime: $675,183
- Treasury: $2,288,192

**Ethereum:**

**Protocol Reserves & Liquidation Fees**

- Protocol Reserves: $147,331
- Liquidation Fees: $0
- Total: $147,331

**Tokenomic Allocations:**

The XVS Buyback was executed gradually over the quarter for BNB Chain and has yet to be converted for Ethereum and ZKsync Era.

**If approved, this VIP will perform the following actions:**

**For all chains, XVS Vault rewards were adjusted as per [VIP 419](https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/419?chainId=56). The new speeds will include these changes.**

**BNB Chain:**

- XVS Buyback Allocation: Send the 89,392 converted XVS from the [XVS Vault Treasury](https://bscscan.com/address/0x269ff7818DB317f60E386D2be0B259e1a324a40a) to the [XVS Store](https://bscscan.com/address/0x1e25CF968f12850003Db17E0Dba32108509C4359), for the new XVS vault rewards.
- XVS Vault Speed: Set the new XVS Vault reward speed to **1,440 daily XVS.**

**Ethereum:**

- XVS Buyback Allocation: Send the 3,207 converted XVS from the [XVS Vault Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaE39C38AF957338b3cEE2b3E5d825ea88df02EfE) to the [XVS Store](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1Db646E1Ab05571AF99e47e8F909801e5C99d37B), for the new XVS vault rewards.
- XVS Vault Speed: Set the new XVS Vault reward speed to **200 daily XVS.**

**Arbitrum one:**

- XVS Buyback Allocation: Send the 740 converted XVS from the [XVS Vault Treasury](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb076D4f15c08D7A7B89466327Ba71bc7e1311b58) to the [XVS Store](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x507D9923c954AAD8eC530ed8Dedb75bFc893Ec5e), for the new XVS vault rewards.
- XVS Vault Speed: Set the new XVS Vault reward speed to **42 daily XVS.**

**ZKsync Era:**

- Token converters have yet to be deployed for this chain. All allocations for XVS vault rewards for this quarter will be used in the next.
- XVS Vault Speed: Set the new XVS Vault reward speed to **35 daily XVS.**
