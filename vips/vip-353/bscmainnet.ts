    description: `This VIP will perform the following Risk Parameter actions as per Chaos Labsâ€™ latest recommendations in this Venus community forum publication: [Chaos Labs - Risk Parameter Updates - 08/02/24](https://community.venus.io/t/chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-08-02-24/4502).

- [WETH (Liquid Staked ETH)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc82780Db1257C788F262FBbDA960B3706Dfdcaf2):
    - Reduce Collateral Factor, from 90% to 0%
    - Increase Kink, from 80% to 90%
    - Increase Multiplier, from 3.5% to 4.5%
    - Increase Reserve Factor, from 15% to 25%

Complete analysis and details of these recommendations are available in the above publication.

Please note that reducing the collateral factor to 0% will not cause current borrowers to be liquidated as the liquidation threshold will not be modified.
