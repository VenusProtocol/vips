In the [VIP-372](https://app.venus.io/#/governance/proposal/372?chainId=56) the single transaction and daily XVS bridge limits for BNB Chain â†’ zkSync were updated, but the associated limits on zkSync were not updated. In this VIP, these limits are set to the expected values:

- Maximum bridged XVS in a single transaction: 20,000 USD
- Maximum bridged XVS in 24 hours: 100,000 USD
